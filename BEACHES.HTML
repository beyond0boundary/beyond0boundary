<h2><Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 20" color="Blue">Discover the Most Popular Beaches in the Phillippines</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">There are dozens of picturesque beaches in the Philippines, a country with over 7,000 islands. You will find these stunning beaches in different parts of the country. Some are famous for their white sand and clear water, while others are known for their vibrant nightlife scene.
There are probably some beaches among our favourites that might be new to you. If you have a thirst for adventure, this list of the best beaches in the Philippines may give you some new travel plans, especially if you’ve been to the popular beaches in El Nido and Boracay. It may take a long time to travel from one beach to the next, but the trip is well worth it.

White Beach is located on the island of Borocay, about 315 km to the south of Manila. This beach is situated off the Panay Island’s north-western tip and represents the aesthetically rich natural scenery of Borocay and the Philippines. There are tropical surroundings, panoramic ocean view, and various forms of vegetation and wildlife. 
White Beach is about 3 km long, and has been divided into three sections, each having its characteristic charm and uniqueness. While Station 1 presents a quiet, low key atmosphere where most of the luxurious resorts and hotels are present, Station 2 is livelier thanks to its expansive shopping, entertainment and dining zones. The quietest part is Station 3, which has several native houses and bungalows.

White Island is an uninhabited sandbar, so there isn't any trees or man-made structures that could offer protection from the sun. If you're going, make sure to bring enough water and sunblock. It's good for snorkelling, but be wary of sea urchins and sea snakes. 
The sandbar is really stunning though – its shape and size changes according to the tide and the season. You'll enjoy the fine sand and clean waters, while the view of Hibok-Hibok Volcano makes for postcard-worthy snapshots. The best time to go to White Island is during summer as boats usually won’t venture out when the weather is bad.

Daku, Naked and Guyam are a group of islets in Siargao that are accessible by joining an island-hopping tour. A day trip to these destinations typically starts at Naked Island, named due to the absence of vegetation or coconut trees. The heat can be rather scorching, so bring sunblock along with you. The islet’s white sand is popular for sunbathing before continuing to the next stop. 
Guyam Island is an interesting mix of sandy beach on one end and hard corals on the other. The final stop is the Daku Island, where you can have your lunch of fresh seafood and coconut juice in either a rented hut or beneath the palm trees. Its serene and crystal-clear water and fine, white sand makes it ideal for swimming.

Kalanggaman Island in Leyte is one of the most beautiful islands in the Philippines. Its major draw is its long sandbar that stretches from one end of the island. It is quite spectacular when the tide ebbs to reveal it. Signs urge you to be careful if you're not a good swimmer, as the sandbank moves together with the changing tides. 
Camping is allowed on the island – on clear nights, you can see the night sky dotted with millions of stars. Boat rental going to Kalanggaman Island costs 3,000 pesos on average. If you're sharing the boat with another group, make sure to agree on your return time since the boat only makes 1 trip back to the mainland.

There's a reason why the 4-km-long Nacpan Beach is considered as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. It's a nice break from the endless island-hopping tours or hanging around the busier beaches in El Nido. Here, you get pristine blue waters and soft sand – sometimes you get to have the beach all to yourself. While there are no fancy restaurants on Nacpan Beach, there are small shacks where you can enjoy local snacks. 
At the end of the beach, there's a small hill that you can climb to see the twin beaches of Nacpan and Calitang. You can rent a tricycle to get there. A good portion of the road is in bad shape, so be prepared for a bumpy and sometimes muddy ride.
