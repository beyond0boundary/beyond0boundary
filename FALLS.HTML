<h2><Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 20" color="Blue">Amazing Waterfalls in the Philippines</font></h2>

<P><font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">The Philippines is a tropical paradise renowned for its stunning natural landscapes, and its magnificent waterfalls are among the country's most captivating attractions. From cascading torrents of water to serene falls nestled in lush forests, the Philippines boasts an array of breathtaking waterfalls that will leave you in awe.
With a fascinating history, diverse geography, delicious food, and friendly people, the Philippines are in many ways an island paradise to the tourists from around the world who are lucky enough to visit.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue"> Aliwagwag Falls</FONT><P>
<CENTER><img src="IMG\Aliwagwag.jpg" HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" alt="" title="Enjoy Your Visiting!"></CENTER><p>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Another of the Philippines’ falls vying for the contentious and disputed king of waterfalls is Aliwagwag Falls in Cateel, Davao Oriental.
At nearly 1,000 feet, it’s big by any standards. As if that weren’t enough, it’s comprised of over 120 individual drops or falls that, when seen together, are truly magnificent.
Don’t worry about seeing them all; one is just as marvelous as the next. So, once you’ve seen a handful, find one that’s just perfect for you and take a dip or snap a few photos.
There’s a bridge across the road near the bottom that will take you directly to the falls.
From Cateel, the falls are an easy journey, though getting to Cateel in the first place will be the trickiest part of.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue">Tinago Falls</FONT><P>
<CENTER><img src="IMG\Tinago.jpeg" HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" alt="" title="Enjoy Your Visiting!"></CENTER><p>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Iligan City is famous for its waterfalls and among all the competition, Tinago Falls is one of the most scenic and often visited.
Located on the Agust River in the island of Mindanao in the southern Philippines, Tinago Falls consists of five individual falls — or tiers — and reaches skyward 240 feet into the surrounding jungle canopy, making them seem like an undiscovered relic from an age long past.
Tinago Falls is steeped in macabre local lore, but when you see the shimmering pool beckoning below the wispy falls, you won’t care a bit.
There’s a loop trail leading from the main trail that is suitable for all ages.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue">Maria Cristina Falls</FONT><P>
<CENTER><img src="IMG\Maria.jpeg" HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" alt="" title="Enjoy Your Visiting!"></CENTER><p>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Iligan City is known as The City of Majestic Falls for good reason. If you’ve been paying attention, it’s a name that should ring a bell, as it’s home to most of the Philippines falls.
Towering over 300 feet above the forest canopy and Agus River below, the falls are often referred to as Twin Falls, because a rock near the base divides the falling water into two distinct streams.
Located 20 minutes outside the city, the falls are a source of electricity for the region.
Due to strong currents and the nearby hydroelectric plant, swimming is off-limits. The falls are at their most magnificent when the operators allow the water to flow freely.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue"> Pagsanjan Falls</FONT><P>
<CENTER><img src="IMG\pagsanjan.jpeg" HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" alt="" title="Enjoy Your Visiting!"></CENTER><p>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Another popular cascade is Pagsanjan Falls, near Cavitini in the Laguna Province
One of the region’s major attractions, the three-tiered falls can be reached by indigenous dugout canoe, or, if that sounds a bit extreme, it’s possible to hike in and out from Cavitini.
If you decide to go with the former option, take your time to ask for recommendations, as you’ll want an experienced guide who’ll be able to take you in and out safely.
The tallest section of the fall is nearly 400 feet. The falls, canyon, and the surrounding areas were made a national park in the ‘70s.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue">Asik-Asik Falls</FONT><P>
<CENTER><img src="IMG\Asik-Asik.jpg" HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" alt="" title="Enjoy Your Visiting!"></CENTER><p>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Despite the effort required to get to Asik-Asik Falls, it’s become a relative hotspot in recent years and is often ranked among the most spectacular falls in the country.
Located in Alamada, North Cotabato, the powerful falls are famous for their frothy water cascading down the rock face that seems to protrude from nowhere from the surrounding forest.
At nearly 200 feet tall, and wider even still, the falls source is a subterranean river.
Getting to the falls takes a bone-jarring motorcycle ride and hefty hike, so it’s not for everybody, but if you go, it’ll be well worth it.
