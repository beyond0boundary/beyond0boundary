<b><Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size="5" color="Blue">Filipino Cousines</font></b><p>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Filipino culture is one that is rooted in family and community, and our favorite way to bond is always through food! Asking someone if they have eaten is the universal Filipino expression of love and care, and it's in sharing a meal that we also share meaningful conversations and experiences.
Food has always been at the heart of our shared history. Our cuisine may be shaped by many foreign influences throughout the years, but it still has that iconic flavor that is distinctly our own.

<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Filipino Food Chicharon deep fried Pork Belly</CENTER><p>
You may have heard of Chicharon from Spain. “Chicharron” refers to deep-fried pork rinds that people eat as a snack or a quick appetizer. 
In the Philippines, you may find deep-fried pork rinds in stores and restaurants. But the term is broader, referring to deep-fried appetizers made with different meats. 
There are many variants of Chicharon. Chicharon Manok consists of deep-fried chicken skin while Chicharon Bulakak is a deep-fried intestinal membrane. Restaurants serve Chicharon with vinegar to add a sour flavor to the dish. Check out this traditional recipe of Chicharon that you can make at home with ease.

<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Balut Fertilized Duck Egg Filipino Food</CENTER><p>
Balut is perhaps the most infamous food in the Philippines. Chefs prepare balut by fertilizing and incubating duck eggs for a few weeks. They then boil the eggs and serve them to customers, eating the embryos from their shells. The embryos are seasoned with salt and chilis. Some restaurants like to saute their embryos and serve them with different vegetables. 
Many people find balut challenging because of their appearance and nature. Balut may contain bones or feathers. But most residents of the Philippines enjoy it and you can find it in most restaurants at low prices.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue"> Adobo</font><p>
<CENTER><img src="IMG\ADOBO.jpeg" HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" alt="" title="Enjoy Your Meal!"></CENTER><P>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Adobo is another important food in the Philippines. It is a national dish that you can find almost anywhere in the country. 
Chefs make Adobo by marinating vegetables and proteins in sauces. They may mix vinegar with soy sauce, black pepper, and garlic. Once the ingredients have marinated, the chef simmers them in low heat until a thick sauce forms.
Vegetarians can eat Adobong kangkong. It is a non-meat version of Adobo that relies on water spinach. Meat eaters can eat it as a side dish with meat and rice. This is a dish you have to try either in the Philippines or at home.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue"> Kakanin (Sticky Rice Cake)</font><p>
<CENTER><img src="IMG\KAKANIN.jpeg" HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" alt="" title="Enjoy Your Meal!"></CENTER><P>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Kakanin refers to any dessert that contains glutinous rice paste. Puto is a rice cake that chefs steam. They may put fruit juice or cook the cakes with fruit so that they have different colors on top. 
Kutsinta is another kind of rice cake. The cake contains lye in it, which makes the cake sticky and chewy within the mouth. The cake is orange because chefs combine the rice paste with achiote seeds. 
If you are not fond of cakes, you can eat Suman. It is a porridge made with glutinous rice and coconut milk. Chefs wrap the porridge in banana leaves, which impart subtle hints of banana without overpowering the other ingredients.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue">Taho (Sweet Tofu)</FONT><P>
<CENTER><img src="IMG\TAHO.jpeg" HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" alt="" title="Enjoy Your Meal!"><P>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Taho filipino Food in the Philippines</CENTER><P>
Douhua is a custard from China made with fresh tofu. Taho is a variant of douhua with additional ingredients and a unique cooking style. It is extremely popular amongst Filipinos in suburban areas, as taho vendors go around and sell the dish. 
Taho has simple syrup as a topping. It also contains sago pearls, which are very similar to tapioca. You can also find taho with cut fruit and flavored syrups.
The chef whips the custard so it becomes akin to a liquid. Some people like to drink their taho out of the bowl, though others use a spoon to scoop up the sago pearls.

<CENTER><img src="IMG\ATI-ATIHAN.jpeg" HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" alt="" title="Enjoy Your Visiting!"></CENTER><P>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Location: Kalibo, Aklan<p>
Date: The Third Sunday of January<p>
What to expect:<p>
Now around 800 years old, this is the wildest and most colourful celebration in the Philippines. On the third week of January, the local residents of Kalibo lather brightly coloured paints onto their skin, and stick feathers on their bodies in preparation for a week long parade in remembrance of Santo Niño. There is no change in dynamics between sunrise and sundown, the rhythm of the drums and the vibrancy of the parades continue on creating an infectious atmosphere. You’ll hear passionate chants for the worshipped Santo Niño and be mesmerised by the exceptional decoration. This is an all day, all night celebration, not for the faint hearted.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue">Sinulog Festival<p></font>
<img src="IMG\SINULOG.jpg" HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" alt="" title="Enjoy Your Visiting!"><P>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Location: Cebu City<p>
Date: Every third week of January<p>
What to expect:<p>
A fascinating festival that aims to connect the history and culture of the past, with contemporary Philippines culture, Sinulog Festival is broadly described as a festival that honours the image and significance (past and present) of Santo Niño. Sinulog has been taking place for over 20 years in Cebu city, and attracts revellers, costume-makers, and culture-seekers from across the world. Though there are photo contests, film contests, and fun-runs all on offer, the main feature is unquestionably the grand parade. Wave after wave of colour, dance, and pageantry snakes through streets that become increasingly excitable as the entire Cebu community comes out in full force.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue">Masskara Festival</font><p>
<CENTER><img src="IMG\MASSKARA1.jpeg" HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" alt="" title="Enjoy Your Visiting!"></CENTER><P>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Location: Bacolod City<p>
Date: October<p>
What to expect:<p>
Now, if this celebration does not put a grin on your face then we don’t know what will. Each October, the people of Bacolod celebrate their nickname of ‘the city of smiles’. During the 1980’s, the city went through a sugar cane crisis; in order to lift their spirits and encourage hope, the Masskara Festival was born. Today, the celebration includes beauty pageants, street dancing, and more importantly a sea of giant smiling masks. Wherever you look, this masquerade ball has the jolliest and most decorative costumes, beaming with the widest smiles; it’s a sight like no other.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue">Pinagbenga Festival</font><p>
<img src="IMG\PINAGBENGA.jpeg" HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" alt="" title="Enjoy Your Visiting!"><P>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Location: Baguio City<p>
Date: During the Holy Week in March or April<p>
What to expect:<p>
In Pinagbenga, you’re going to see more flowers in a day than you would in a lifetime. Named after the Kankanaey term that means “season of blooming”, the festival highlights the traditions, values, and history of Baguio and the Cordilleras.
It is also a tribute to Baguio’s thriving flower plantations and its rise from the 1990 Luzon earthquake. Lasting over a month-long, this festival is one of the longest in the Philippines. For travelers looking for Instagram-worthy photos, the festival is a feast for the eyes.
