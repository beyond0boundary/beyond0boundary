<font face="Times New Roman" size="5">One of the Philippines many monuments commemorating moments during WWII, Leyte Landing Monument represents a fulfilled promise.<br>
In 1942, when Japanese forces occupied the Philippines, General Douglas MacArthur from the US Armed Forces infamously said “I shall return”, meaning he would return to the country and free the people from Japanese occupation.<br>
In 1944, MacArthur landed back on the Philippines by boat and fought to regain control of the country, by pushing the Japanese out.<br>
The site where he returned is marked by statues of American soldiers, and General MacArthur, standing in a shallow pool of water.<br>
Two commemorative plaques have also been laid, retelling the story.<br>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="5">In Cebu stands the Basilica del Santo Nino, the oldest basilica in the Philippines.<br>
The building was constructed in the 1700s and was built to be able to survive earthquakes.<br>
The façade is simple in its design, taking influences from Muslim, Romanesque and Neoclassical architectural styles.<br>
Inside, ceilings are decorated with elaborate paintings depicting biblical scenes.<br>
It is however the holy relic of Santo Nino that draws people to this beautiful basilica.<br>
The relic is a gem-festooned statue of the holy infant Jesus and was a gift for Queen Juana for her baptism in 1521.<br>
It is said that during a fire that destroyed much of Cebu and the church itself, the relic remained undamaged.<br>

Now a national landmark of the Philippines and shrine to the freedom of the country, the 16th century Fort Santiago is a must-see landmark in Manila.<br>
The fort is a stone structure designed in an Italian-Spanish architectural style and reflects key moments in the countries history.<br>
The fort once served as a prison for the hero of the Philippines Jose Rizal before he was executed in 1896.<br>
Now, a museum has been built to share his legacy with visitors.<br>
Look out for Rizal’s footsteps in bronze on the floor, which marks the route he took from his cell to the firing squad that would end his life.<br>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="5">Rizal’s monuments are historic landmarks in Manila.<br>
Within the Jose Rizal Memorial Protected Landscape, sometimes called Rizal Park, are many important statues commemorating Jose Rizal.<br>
The park stretches over 60 hectares and is gilled with lush lawns, ponds, wooded areas and ornamental gardens.<br>
It is however the statues of Filipino heroes that are the gardens biggest draw.<br>
The park is where Jose Rizal was executed by Spanish colonial authorities, and so has great historical importance within the countries culture.<br>
That’s why the Rizal Monument is a must-visit landmark when in the park.<br>
Within the monument are the remains of Jose Rizal, a national hero. Sentries in full regalia stand guard.<br>
