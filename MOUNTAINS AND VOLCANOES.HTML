<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Although the Philippines is known for its beautiful beaches, another steadily rising activity for the average Philippine traveler is found a little further inland: the mountains. Over the past couple of decades, mountaineering has slowly begun to grow in popularity, and thanks to social media is now more visible than ever before. Climbing tours are now more accessible to both groups and single climbers, and even major news sites such as Rappler have posted beginners’ guides to hiking.
If you’re looking to check off a few more things on your bucket list, consider some of the famous Philippine climbs on our list below!

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue"> Mt. Pinatubo, Central Luzon</font><p>

The source of so much devastation after its eruption in 1991, reaching the crater of the famous Mt. Pinatubo is nevertheless a breathtaking sight. Start with a 45-minute ride on a 4×4 from Capas, Tarlac straight to the foot of the mountain, where you’ll pass a plain of volcanic sand and little streams colored by minerals. At the crater, you can take in the view, or try swimming across the lake. The barrenness that makes it so awe-inspiring may be forested in the next few decades, so take in the sights while you can!

Mt. Apo is often seen as the “final challenge” for Philippine mountaineers before they start looking to climb taller mountains in other countries. There are several trails to reach the top of Mt. Apo, but perhaps the two most well-known are the Kidapawan Trail from North Cotabato, which features tropical forests and hot springs, and the Kapatagan Trail in Davao, which has a rockier, more volcanic approach. The Kidapawan-Kapatagan Traverse spans two provinces and the tallest mountain in the Philippines, and any mountaineer worth their salt will want to check this off the bucket list.

<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">The Philippines sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire. This position allows for the formation of volcanoes especially at the junction between the Philippines and Eurasian tectonic plates. As a result, the Philippines is blessed with hundreds of active and dormant volcanoes.
But what are the most active volcanoes in the Philippines? According to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), these are Mts. Mayon, Taal, Kanlaon, Bulusan, and Ragang. There are 20 active volcanoes in the Philippines, mostly located on Luzon island.
While the idea of a volcanic eruption seems daunting and scary, it is actually one of the best spectacles in nature. That is not to say it is not dangerous. As a matter of fact, there have been very destructive eruptions of volcanoes in the Philippines.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue">Mt. Mayon/ Mayon Volcano</font><p>
<CENTER><img src="PIC\MAYON VOLCANO1.jpeg" HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" alt="" title="Enjoy Your Visiting!"></CENTER><P>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Considered to be one of the most beautiful volcanoes in the world because of its almost perfect conical shape, Mt. Mayon is also the most active volcano in the Philippines. It is located in the province of Albay in the Bicol region.
Mayo has erupted at least 47 times in the last 500 years, the one in 1814 being the most destructive. The eruption buried the town of Cagsawa, leaving over a thousand people dead. The church tower in most photos of Mt. Mayon is a reminder of the catastrophic event.
PHIVOLCS permanently monitors Mt. Mayon. Activities have been observed over the years, including a surprise eruption in 2013. This event killed 5 climbers and left 7 others injured. In 2018, the entire Albay province was placed under a state of calamity as ash, lava, and steam spewed from Mayon’s crater. In early 2020, a magma glow was observed on the volcano’s crater.
Despite and because of its activities, Mt. Mayon remains to be one of the most popular attractions in the Philippines.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue">Taal Volcano</font><P>
<CENTER><img src="PIC\Taal Vol.jpeg" HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" alt="" title="Enjoy Your Visiting!"></CENTER><P>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Known as a volcano island inside a lake in a bigger volcano, Taal is definitely the most interesting volcano in the Philippines. It is also the deadliest. It is located in Batangas, just hours from Manila. Taal is a breathtaking attraction viewed from Tagaytay. Trekking along the volcano was also a popular activity.
Taal has erupted at least 34 times; its latest was in early 2022. The recent eruptions were destructive, affecting the entire region, Metro Manila, parts of Central Luzon, and even as far as Pangasinan in Ilocos. The towns have since recovered from the effects of the eruptions and but a number of people lost their lives because they refused to evacuate.
The eruptions expelled most of the water out of the main crater’s lake but quickly reformed when the rainy season began. Taal volcano remains to be a beautiful natural attraction with plenty of hotels, cafes, and restaurants surrounding it.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue">Mt. Kanlaon</font><P>
<CENTER><img src="PIC\Mt Kanlaon.jpeg" HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" alt="" title="Enjoy Your Visiting!"></CENTER><P>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">The third most active volcano in the Philippines is Mt. Kanlaon in Negros Oriental. It has erupted at least 30 times but most of them have only been mild. It only spewed lava during its eruption in 1904.
There have been activities recorded for Mt. Kanlaon in recent years including volcanic earthquakes and mild eruptions involving ash columns and loud booming sounds. None of these eruptions were destructive.
Mt. Kanlaon is the highest point in the Visayas with an elevation of about 8000 feet above sea level. It is an extremely popular destination for mountain climbers and relaxation seekers. Hot springs around the volcano like Mambucal, Bucalan, and Bungol are just a three-hour scenic drive from Bacolod City.
